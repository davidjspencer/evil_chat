# README

This project is a standard Rails application to cater for modern front-end practices. We are using Webpacker gem to build our assets with Webpack while PostCSS and cssnext are processing our styles. Babel, Autoprefixer, and Browserslist allow us not worry about cross-browser issues. Our code is automatically checked for syntax errors with Prettier, AirBnB Base Config, ESLint, and stylelint on each git commit.

* Ruby 2.4.2

* Rails 5.1.4
